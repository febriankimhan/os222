# LINKS

1. [Basic Linux Commands](https://linuxopsys.com/topics/basic-linux-commands)<br>
This is a link to some of the most used Linux commands.
It's pretty useful to get you started with Linux.

2. [Basic vi Commands](https://www.cs.colostate.edu/helpdocs/vi.html)<br>
This is a concise docs of several vi commands.
Like the first link, it's pretty useful when you're just starting editing some files with vi.

3. [Introduction to Nano Text Editor](https://itsfoss.com/nano-editor-guide/)<br>
So, a friend of mine introduced me a text editor called Nano.
He said that it's simpler than vi.
But, the only reason that I like Nano better than vi is that I can copy text from outside of this editor and paste it here.
So, if you have this problem, you can open up this link and learn Nano!
It also has a cheatsheet at the bottom of the page, so it'll definitely helpful if you want to search for some commands later on.
