# LINKS

## Week 01
1. [Basic Linux Commands](https://linuxopsys.com/topics/basic-linux-commands)<br>
This is a link to some of the most used Linux commands.
It's pretty useful to get you started with Linux.

2. [Basic vi Commands](https://www.cs.colostate.edu/helpdocs/vi.html)<br>
This is a concise docs of several vi commands.
Like the first link, it's pretty useful when you're just starting editing some files with vi.

## Week 02
3. [Introduction to Nano Text Editor](https://itsfoss.com/nano-editor-guide/)<br>
So, a friend of mine introduced me a text editor called Nano.
He said that it's simpler than vi.
But, the only reason that I like Nano better than vi is that I can copy text from outside of this editor and paste it here.
So, if you have this problem, you can open up this link and learn Nano!
It also has a cheatsheet at the bottom of the page, so it'll definitely helpful if you want to search for some commands later on.

## Week 03
4. [Fragmentation Explained](https://www.scaler.com/topics/what-is-fragmentation-in-os/)<br>
Fragmentation is a problem in operating system related to processes and main memory usage.
This link will explain in detail how this problem occur including several types of it, such as internal and external fragmentation.

## Week 04
5. [Pointers in C](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mw1qsMieK5c)<br>
This is a video explaining about pointers in C language.
It's a ten-minute video explaining about what pointer is and how to use it.
The topic here is still basic yet explained pretty well and in detail.

6. [Memory Management in OS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdkxXygc3rE)<br>
It's basically this-week's course in 9 minutes.
You'll learn about how memory is being used to handle multiple kind of tasks.
It's pretty good if you're just starting or just want to review the topic.

## Week 05
7. [Virtual Memory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2quKyPnUShQ)<br>
This is a video explaining about virtual memory and how it works.
It's eleven minutes long but it's pretty detailed about how it's stored and the process behind it

8. [Optimal Page Replacement](https://youtu.be/DXU7SqsYDvg?t=487)<br>
For a while, I can't seem to understand exactly how optimal page replacement works.
After watching this video, I got full understanding about it and what it is best suited for.
Although this video discusses two page replacement techniques (LRU and Optimal), I've set the link so you can immediately go to the optimal page replacement explanation.

9. [Belady's Anomaly](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/beladys-anomaly-in-page-replacement-algorithms/)<br>
This link explains about what Belady's Anomaly that you possibly encounter in page replacement algorithms.
It also explains about which algorithms it occurs the most or even impossible to occur.

## Week 06
10. [Process IDs in C](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZrQ4eGm-hM)<br>
Fork function basically creates a clone of the program it runs.
But, there are also process ids which determines which process this id belongs to.
This video explains it in a comprehensive yet very simple way.

11. [wait() in C](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYo6hipaSA)<br>
When we fork a program, it creates a duplicate of it and will run at the same time.
This means that the output will be very messy and will almost always different than the previous times because both parent and child processes are trying to output the result at the process.
wait() function is useful so that you can organize how the output will be shown from these processes.
THis video explains what wait() function is and how to use it properly in a basic way.

12. [Multitasking vs Multithreading vs Multiprocessing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn0u-IIBmtc)<br>
When you first heard it while learning OS, you feel like they're doing something in "multiple" way but not sure what differentiates one with another.
This video explains these terms very nicely.

## Week 07
13. [DeadlockðŸ˜ˆ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkWXaXAgbY)<br>
This is a short video about deadlock in OS.
It explained what deadlock is and what conditions that can make deadlock to occur.

14. [Is This Deadlock Prevention or Deadlock Avoidance?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-deadlock-prevention-and-deadlock-avoidance/)<br>
These terms are different but serve for the same purpose, which is to prevent (or avoid? ðŸ¤”) deadlock occurences.
This website explained the differences between them and also has a comparison table which described their differences on various factors.

## Week 08
15. [SJF with Prediction of Burst Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ga42aZzKGw)<br>
Shortest-Job-First (SJF) is one scheduling algorithm that gives out the best performance as it has the least average waiting time compared to other algorithms.
The available processes are sorted based on their process length ascendingly.
The problem is actual available processes are not given all at once, but changing dinamically.
Then, we need to have the ability to predict the next cpu bursts.
This video explains this topic very comprehensively and easy to understand.

16. [Round Robin Algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jFGYDfWkXI)<br>
I didn't really understand about Round Robin algorithm in class.
So, I searched for videos explaining about it.
This video explained it really well.
